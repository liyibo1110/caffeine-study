abstract class StripedBuffer<E> implements Buffer<E> {
    /*
     * This class maintains a lazily-initialized table of atomically updated buffers. The table size
     * is a power of two. Indexing uses masked per-thread hash codes. Nearly all declarations in this
     * class are package-private, accessed directly by subclasses.
     *
     * Table entries are of class Buffer and should be padded to reduce cache contention. Padding is
     * overkill for most atomics because they are usually irregularly scattered in memory and thus
     * don't interfere much with each other. But Atomic objects residing in arrays will tend to be
     * placed adjacent to each other, and so will most often share cache lines (with a huge negative
     * performance impact) without this precaution.
     *
     * In part because Buffers are relatively large, we avoid creating them until they are needed.
     * When there is no contention, all updates are made to a single buffer. Upon contention (a failed
     * CAS inserting into the buffer), the table is expanded to size 2. The table size is doubled upon
     * further contention until reaching the nearest power of two greater than or equal to the number
     * of CPUS. Table slots remain empty (null) until they are needed.
     *
     * A single spinlock ("tableBusy") is used for initializing and resizing the table, as well as
     * populating slots with new Buffers. There is no need for a blocking lock; when the lock is not
     * available, threads try other slots. During these retries, there is increased contention and
     * reduced locality, which is still better than alternatives.
     *
     * The Thread probe fields maintained via ThreadLocalRandom serve as per-thread hash codes. We let
     * them remain uninitialized as zero (if they come in this way) until they contend at slot 0. They
     * are then initialized to values that typically do not often conflict with others. Contention
     * and/or table collisions are indicated by failed CASes when performing an update operation. Upon
     * a collision, if the table size is less than the capacity, it is doubled in size unless some
     * other thread holds the lock. If a hashed slot is empty, and lock is available, a new Buffer is
     * created. Otherwise, if the slot exists, a CAS is tried. Retries proceed by "double hashing",
     * using a secondary hash (Marsaglia XorShift) to try to find a free slot.
     *
     * The table size is capped because, when there are more threads than CPUs, supposing that each
     * thread were bound to a CPU, there would exist a perfect hash function mapping threads to slots
     * that eliminates collisions. When we reach capacity, we search for this mapping by randomly
     * varying the hash codes of colliding threads. Because search is random, and collisions only
     * become known via CAS failures, convergence can be slow, and because threads are typically not
     * bound to CPUS forever, may not occur at all. However, despite these limitations, observed
     * contention rates are typically low in these cases.
     *
     * It is possible for a Buffer to become unused when threads that once hashed to it terminate, as
     * well as in the case where doubling the table causes no thread to hash to it under expanded
     * mask. We do not try to detect or remove buffers, under the assumption that for long-running
     * instances, observed contention levels will recur, so the buffers will eventually be needed
     * again; and for short-lived ones, it does not matter.
